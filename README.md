This repository is for ICS Web Development Extra Credit Assignment. 

This repository contains the files for my Personal Website. 
The directory structure is as per the assignment guidelines (i.e. according to the screenshot below).

This website contains 4 pages:
- The home page (index.html)
- An "Experience" page (experience.html) that includes any experience I have in terms of extracurriculars.
- An interests page (interests.html) that includes video games and books that I enjoy.
- A "secret" page for members of the ICS teaching team.

  The entry point is 'index.html'.

  This website does not have "features;" it is primarily a space for me to learn WebDev programming.
