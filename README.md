This website contains 4 pages:
- The home page (index.html)
- An "Experience" page (experience.html) that includes any experience I have in terms of extracurriculars.
- An interests page (interests.html) that includes video games and books that I enjoy.
- A "secret" page for members of the ICS teaching team.

  The entry point is 'index.html'.

  This website does not have "features;" it is primarily a space for me to learn WebDev programming. 

Please find screenshots of the website attached below.
